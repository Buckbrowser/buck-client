# buck-client
Front-end implementing the API from [buck-server](https://github.com/Buckbrowser/buck-server/)

## Setting up development environment
1. Clone buck-client to your machine and change directory to it.
2. Install [npm](https://nodejs.org) if you haven't done so already.
3. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) if you haven't done so already by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. Run `npm install`
5. 
  * Use `grunt` to build the angular-app-javascript file and to build bootstrap from less.
  * Use `grunt server` to startup a server that will automagically check for file changes, recompile when so and refresh the webpage afterwards.
